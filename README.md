**Description :spiral_notepad:  :** 

:wave:  Hello ! Today I'm releasing `mth-rc`, a resource created with @Dark-Animations and @TayMcKenzie. This resource is a standalone resource that allows you to spawn a rc car and control it with your keyboard. See the showcase video below to see how it works !

**Usage :hammer_and_wrench: :**

To use the resource, download it, put the `mth-rc` folder in your main resources folder.
Add `start mth-rc` to your server.cfg
Then, once you're in game, use the command /rc to get started !

**Features :sparkles: :**
* STANDALONE : this means that you don't need any dependencies to start this script on your server
* Easy to use
* FREE
* Configurable
